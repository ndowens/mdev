- Reduce proc-bus-usb (should be dev-bus-usb anyway) as we will have full path where to store device nodes anyway.
- Migrate to busybox's uevent helper which listens on netlink and then runs mdev for each of the notification.
- usb mode switch
- Consider using 'add' >event instead of `mdev -s` as we could use the $DEVNAME and $DEVPATH.
